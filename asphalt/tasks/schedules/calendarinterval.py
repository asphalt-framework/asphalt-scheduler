class CalendarIntervalSchedule(BaseSchedule):
    """
    Runs the task on specified calendar-based intervals always at the same exact time of day.

    When calculating the next date, the ``years`` and ``months`` parameters are first added to the
    previous date while keeping the day of the month constant. This is repeated until the resulting
    date is valid. After that, the ``weeks`` and ``days`` parameters are added to that date.
    Finally, the date is combined with the given time (hour, minute, second) to form the final
    datetime.

    This means that if the ``days`` or ``weeks`` parameters are not used, the task will always be
    executed on the same day of the month at the same wall clock time, assuming the date and time
    are valid.

    If the resulting datetime is invalid due to a daylight saving forward shift, the process is
    restarted using the date part as the starting point. If instead the datetime is ambiguous due
    to a backward DST shift, the first of the two resulting datetimes is used unless that time has
    already passed, in which case the second one is used.

    If no previous run time is specified when requesting a new run time (like when starting for the
    first time or resuming after being paused), ``start_date`` is used as a reference and the next
    valid datetime equal to or later than the current time will be returned. Otherwise, the next
    valid datetime starting from the previous run time is returned, even if it's in the past.

    .. warning:: Be wary of setting a start date near the end of the month (29. â€“ 31.) if you have
        ``months`` specified in your interval, as this will skip the months where those days do not
        exist. Likewise, setting the start date on the leap day (February 29th) and having
        ``years`` defined may cause some years to be skipped.

        Users are also discouraged from  using a time inside the target timezone's DST switching
        period (typically around 2 am) since a date could either be skipped or repeated due to the
        specified wall clock time either occurring twice or not at all.
